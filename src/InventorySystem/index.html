    <h4> - A detailed description of a logical or runtime error that you corrected in the code and a detailed description of how you corrected it above the line of code you are referring to</h4>
    <p>
        An error that took me around 2 days to solve was a runtime error produced by the IDE. At first I tried using NetBeans but quickly changed my mind and reverted
        back to IntelliJ. I was getting this error on both NetBeans as well as IntelliJ. I added the JavaFX library and changed the VM options to point to the JavaFX
        controls and fxml. I also installed a couple of JavaFX plugins thinking that maybe they would be of use. I decided to just create a test program and load the
        fxml file. I ran the file and instantly got an error "Exception in Application start method". The error was much longer but that was the first line. I scrolled
        in the error message and found a line saying "at application.Main.start(Main.java:14)". On that line, I was loading the MainScreen.FXMl file. After playing around
        with VM options for 3 hours, reinstalling java and JavaFX, searching on google for similar errors that someone may have had(surprisingly no one had the exact problem
        as mine, therefore there wasn't anything helpful), and trying out a bunch of plugins, I finally figured out the cause of the error. The error wasn't being caused by
        any of the things I had touched but instead, it was because I had accidentally included a "/" in front of the "View_Controller" folder path in the FXML loader.

    <h4>- A compatible feature suitable to your application that would extend functionality to the next version if you were to update the application</h4>
    <p>
        If I were to update this application, I would add two features that I think are important in a application such as this one.
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The first feature I would add is a database. I think that a database is necessary for an application such as this one especially
                because you are storing so much important information. Another great reason to have a database is that if you have other people
                that need to have access to that information, you can easily share that database or host that database on a server so that everyone
                has easy access to updated information.
            </li>
            <li>
                The second important feature that I would add to this application is a login page for access the application.
                This is actually related to the database which is the first feature because you will have to store the login
                information in the database. Having a login before accessing this application is crucial for the privacy of
                the company/individuals that will be using the application.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <BR>
